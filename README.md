# Machine Learning Concepts

### Linear Regression

- Statsmodels.api alternative with R functionality for least squares model fit and inference.

- Regression tables similar to R, variance inflation factor, robust standard errors, gradient descent option, advanced predictions, hypothesis testing, cross compatability with numpy and pandas and matplotlib.

### Neural Networks

- **Neural Network with Numpy**

    - Neural network trained on MNIST digits database using numpy.

- **Neural Network with PyTorch**

    - Neural network trained on MNIST digits database. Copy of the Numpy implementation replacing np.array with torch.tensor for acceleration only.
